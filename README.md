# AlgoNFT Dashboard  

## Project Overview  
The AlgoNFT Dashboard is a personalized interface that allows users to manage, track, and analyze their Algorand NFTs efficiently. Unlike a full marketplace, this dashboard focuses only on the logged-in user's assets, providing real-time insights, wallet management, transaction history, and visual analytics.  

## Features  
- Wallet Connection and Authentication – Securely connect with Pera Wallet  
- NFT Portfolio Management – View owned NFTs with metadata, images, and attributes  
- Transaction History – Fetch and display past Algorand transactions related to NFTs  
- Graphical Insights and Analytics – Charts and graphs for portfolio trends, asset distribution, and activity tracking  
- User Profile and Settings – Customize profile and manage user preferences  

## Problem Statement  
Many users struggle with managing their Algorand NFTs due to:  
- No centralized dashboard to track NFT ownership and transactions  
- Complicated wallet interactions for balance and history checking  
- Lack of visual insights into NFT portfolio trends and transaction activity  

## Proposed Solution  
The AlgoNFT Dashboard aims to solve these issues by:  
- Providing a real-time view of NFT holdings and wallet balance  
- Integrating wallet connection and authentication  
- Displaying transaction history  
- Visualizing portfolio trends with charts and graphs
